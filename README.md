# AWS_Solutions_Architect_Python
Taking the AWS Solutions Architect certification path is a great way to test your knowledge and skills in cloud computing/cloud engineering. The one thing we don't see a lot of in the certification path is utilizing the API to automate your tasks. 

This project is to solve just that. As I go through the AWS Solutions Architect material, each of the sections have a lab. Each lab that is done manually, I will automate with Python (or as close as I can get). 

Please Note: This is NOT on the exam. This is simply a way to show you what is going on from a code perspective.
